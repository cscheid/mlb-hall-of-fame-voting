THINGS TO DO

- "some weird artifacts....Warren Spahn appears to start at zero (dont think that is true).." -Chris
 -- explain Spahn, Lefty Grove, maybe Gehrig, Clemente, too:
   -- Kenny to correct Lefty Grove in the data (remove 1960 votes from data)
   -- For Spahn, DiMaggio, consider including playing career as a variable, so we can select only ballot years when player was retired. Kenny to gather data.
   -- For Gehrig, Clemente, consider appending explanation to name, or add two short footnotes. Might need footnote for (1) negro leagues committee, and (2) runoff election, in addition to the Gehrig and Clemente explanations (because they got in via special election).

- Add histograms for:
  - histograms for position and induction method

- Bigger tick mark labels?

- One new feature: can we visualize the years in which a player appeared on the ballot? (maybe as colored tick marks along the x-axis?) This would help viewers interpret straight line segments in the trajectories (i.e. they could tell the difference between someone who received a linear percentage of votes in many consecutive years vs. a person who had a long span of years between receiving any votes).
