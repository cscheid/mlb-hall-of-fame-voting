THINGS TO DO

- "some weird artifacts....Warren Spahn appears to start at zero (dont think that is true).." -Chris
 -- explain Spahn, Lefty Grove, maybe Gehrig, Clemente, too:
   -- Kenny to correct Lefty Grove in the data (remove 1960 votes from data)
   -- For Spahn, DiMaggio, consider including playing career as a variable, so we can select only ballot years when player was retired. Kenny to gather data.
   -- For Gehrig, Clemente, consider appending explanation to name, or add two short footnotes. Might need footnote for (1) negro leagues committee, and (2) runoff election, in addition to the Gehrig and Clemente explanations (because they got in via special election).

- Add histograms for:
 8. Number of years on ballot

- histograms for position and induction method

- rename badly named columns

THINGS TO NOTE

(Notes from Carlos)
- We ran out of dimensions to use (max is 32). I'm removing the AB and R histograms; they seem very strongly correlated with H.


________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Update: 1/19 11am:

- Get first year of playing career and last year of playing career for each of 1070 players.
 -- Kenny got this and updated player_data.csv

- Split "Veterans Committee" category into 3 categories:
 -- Veterans Committee (Player)
 -- Veterans Committee (Manager)
 -- Veterans Committee (Executive)
 -- Kenny has updated the data in player_data.csv
 -- To do: edit category legend and add two colors to color palette

- Kenny to select histogram range for each statistic.

- Kenny to update players with position listed as "OF"
 -- Looks like 22 players may never be classified into LF, RF, CF. The other 79 "OF" are now classified into either LF, RF, or CF.

- Statistics formatting (for the stat line at top of plot, and also for histogram axis labels)
  - Right-justify stats that display above the plot.
  - Set up stats like ERA and BA to always have the right number of significant digits. Kenny will write this down somewhere.


________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Update: 1/22 2:45pm:


To Do:
- Insert above text (3 sections - probable with links to lower portions of the page)
- Right-justify stat category names except Name, Pos, and the words "Batting:" and "Pitching:"
- Right-justify actual statistics except for Name and Pos
- Omit ".1" from category names "H.1", "HR.1", and "BB.1", both in the stat-line and the histograms
- Statistic formatting:
  WAR (1 decimal place)
  BA, OBP, and SLG (3 decimals, and no leading "0")
  OPS (3 decimals, and 1 digit before the decimal)
  ERA, WHIP (2 decimal places)
  IP (1 decimal place)

- The text "x of 1,070 players selected". Make sure it displays properly. Change "Clear Query" to "Clear Selection"
 -- on my laptop, the whole box jumps when I toggle between no selection (by position or method) vs. one selection. Depends on the number of players, "x", selected. Solve by reserving the right amount of space.

- Maybe "Player Search by Name" instead of "Player Name" for search box
- Line up the plot, method legend, and position legend (consider making the position legend multi-column ?)
- Bigger tick mark labels?
- Rotate histograms so increasing values of numbers go either left-to-right (normal layout), or bottom-to-top
- Add in AB and R (delete other categories as necessary)
- Add # of years on ballot as a histogram selection
- Default histograms to show upon clicking the link: WAR, HR, H, W, SO, BA


- One potential bug: If I click a player, and then make a selection that doesn't include that player, and then un-click the player, his trajectory still remains in the display with the other trajectories selected, even though he's not a member of that selection. Can the act of un-clicking him also hide his trajectory, if he is not a member of the current selection?


- One new feature: can we visualize the years in which a player appeared on the ballot? (maybe as colored tick marks along the x-axis?) This would help viewers interpret straight line segments in the trajectories (i.e. they could tell the difference between someone who received a linear percentage of votes in many consecutive years vs. a person who had a long span of years between receiving any votes).



STORIES: (selections to save and link to -- Kenny to explore these and will choose 3-5 of them, probably)

1. First-ballot Hall of Famers
2. On the ballot for 15 years (or more) (or maybe just > 10 years?)
3. 400-HR club
4. 300-W club
5. 3000-H club
6. Shortstops?
7. Maybe pick out the trajectories with the greatest range? (i.e. those who have "travelled the farthest")
8. First year above 40%, say. Or some number like that (to inform projections for current guys)
