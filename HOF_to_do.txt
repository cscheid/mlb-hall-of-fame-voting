Priority fixes:

- The text "x of 1,070 players selected". Make sure it displays properly. Change "Clear Query" to "Clear Selection"
 -- on my laptop, the whole box jumps when I toggle between no selection (by position or method) vs. one selection. Depends on the number of players, "x", selected. Solve by reserving the right amount of space.

- rename badly named columns on scatterplots

- Put back R, remove H.1, put in Mitchell, pending kenny's update; remove HR.1

- add a mention to truncation of histograms in the text

- Statistics formatting (for the stat line at top of plot, and also for histogram axis labels)
  - Right-justify stats that display above the plot.
  - Set up stats like ERA and BA to always have the right number of significant digits. Kenny will write this down somewhere.
- Right-justify stat category names except Name, Pos, and the words "Batting:" and "Pitching:"
- Right-justify actual statistics except for Name and Pos

- Statistic formatting:
  WAR (1 decimal place)
  BA, OBP, and SLG (3 decimals, and no leading "0")
  OPS (3 decimals, and 1 digit before the decimal)
  ERA, WHIP (2 decimal places)
  IP (1 decimal place)

- Maybe "Player Search by Name" instead of "Player Name" for search box

- Default histograms to show upon clicking the link: WAR, HR, H, W, SO, BA

- One potential bug: If I click a player, and then make a selection that doesn't include that player, and then un-click the player, his trajectory still remains in the display with the other trajectories selected, even though he's not a member of that selection. Can the act of un-clicking him also hide his trajectory, if he is not a member of the current selection?

- Add a multiple-selection example query

- test layouts in different resolutions

THINGS TO DO

- "some weird artifacts....Warren Spahn appears to start at zero (dont think that is true).." -Chris
 -- explain Spahn, Lefty Grove, maybe Gehrig, Clemente, too:
   -- Kenny to correct Lefty Grove in the data (remove 1960 votes from data)
   -- For Spahn, DiMaggio, consider including playing career as a variable, so we can select only ballot years when player was retired. Kenny to gather data.
   -- For Gehrig, Clemente, consider appending explanation to name, or add two short footnotes. Might need footnote for (1) negro leagues committee, and (2) runoff election, in addition to the Gehrig and Clemente explanations (because they got in via special election).

- Add histograms for:
  - histograms for position and induction method

- Bigger tick mark labels?

- One new feature: can we visualize the years in which a player appeared on the ballot? (maybe as colored tick marks along the x-axis?) This would help viewers interpret straight line segments in the trajectories (i.e. they could tell the difference between someone who received a linear percentage of votes in many consecutive years vs. a person who had a long span of years between receiving any votes).
